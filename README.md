This is a small HTML test application for logging events to a logdirector server. This is a pure HTML/JS client using knockout.js, Twitter Bootstrap and the logdirector Javascript client that can be found here https://github.com/logdirector/logdirector-js-client. It is packaged as a Java web application for easy deployment on a servlet container (e.g. Tomcat), but you can basically take the files from the *web* folder and host them anywhere else.

You can find a live version of it here:

To view your logged events on our test server open the UI with this link:
